These are my notes for my markdown reading
Markdown is essentially a translator. It assists the user by simplifying how to create what you want on a webpage. For example, in HTML where you might write 
<ul>
  <li> list item </li>
<li> another list item </li?
</ul>
Markdown simplifies this process by allowing the user to create a list by writing
  >

### Inspirational quote;

*The mind is the limit. As long as the mind can envision the fact that you can do something, you can do it, as long as you really believe 100 percent.*
> Arnold Schwarzenegger

## Growth Mindset to me means
Being open to learning, and all the successes and failures that come along with it. 
1. Stay positive, even when you receive criticism or hit a wall.
2. Don't summarize your intelligence by the ease, nor the difficulty of a challenge you face.
3. Hard work and focus will always triumph over raw talent.

## CSS

[Back page](README.md)

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a tool popularly used for styling and improving the visual appearance of a website. You can change background colors, font colors, add borders, change border colors, and much more. 

- CSS works by targeting a "section" or specific item within a webpage, then modifying it's appearence and/or properties.

### Example:

In HTML you might lay out a header for your page by writing
```
<header>
<h1> This is my webpage </h1>
</header>
```
Then you could change the colors or font of that header by targeting it in CSS
```
h1 {
    color: gold;
    font-size: 6em;
}
```
You specify what you want to target (h1), then inside of the {} brackets, you tell it what you want to change. in this example, you are changing the color to gold, and the size of the font.

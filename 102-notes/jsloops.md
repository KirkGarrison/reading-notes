## JavaScript looping notes

[Back page](README.md)

- Looping is a coding function that allows the programmer to create a looping interaction with the user.

- Looping can be based upon a criteria so the program (loop) knows when to continue looping, and when to end the looping cycle.

- This can be useful to create interaction questions or games.

- The programmer designs the loop to continue until a certain criteria is met.

- A common example of this would be when you sign up for a video streaming website (Hulu, Netflix, Prime video etc) The streaming service asks you to list 5 genre's of interest so they can better tailor their suggestions to your likes.

- As you make selections, the service tracks how many choices you have made, and continues to "loop" or prompt you to select another, until you have selected all 5. At that point, the "loop" ends, and you can proceed to the next page.

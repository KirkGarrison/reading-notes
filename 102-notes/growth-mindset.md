[Back page](/102-notes.md)

*Being open to learning, and all the successes and failures that come along with it.*


1. Stay positive, even when you receive criticism or hit a wall.
2. Don't summarize your intelligence by the ease, nor the difficulty of a challenge you face.
3. Hard work and focus will always triumph over raw talent.

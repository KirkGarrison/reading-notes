## HTML notes

[Back page](/102-notes.md)

HTML is a website structuring tool that allows the user to
create the frame of a web page (called a WireFrame).
Some things HTML allows you to do

- Add text/change font style and size
- Insert images
- Create HyperLinks

You start by creating a WireFrame (sketch) of what you want the basic structure of the website to look like. Then you can use HTML and lay the foundation and create the shape of the page(s)

Different structuring tools have different "languages" that they use. HTML utilizes open and closed references for many of it's functions.

### Example:

```
<h1>Cool HTML file name</h1>
<p>This is awesome!</p>
```

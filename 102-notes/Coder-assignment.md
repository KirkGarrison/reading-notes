## Word editors

[Back page](README.md)

Word editors are programs designed to assist people with saving and writing things down.
Today we are focusing on two different types of word editors:
* Writing editors
* Code editors
Although both of these can be called *word editors*, they have different functions.
A word editor used for writing, would be something like Microsoft word, or Google docs. It has easy access features for writing
such as italics, bold, underline, font adjustment, etc..
However in a coding focused word editor, you would want different features.
Things like syntax highlighters (highlights certain words to make it more readable) and code completion (it's a lot like
googles auto-fill sentences when you start typing in google). Which assists in enabling faster, and more accurate coding.

Shortcuts:
```
PWD = Print Working Directory

ls = list
ls -a = list all contents of directory
cd = change directory
cd ~ (tilde) = home directory
code = opens up VS code
mkdir = make directory
cp = copy (file or directory)
mv = move (file or directory)
git clone + link
git add file_name (add . for add all)
git commit -m "add notes here"
git push origin main
git status (status check after every step)
```

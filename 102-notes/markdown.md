## Markdown

[Back page](/102-notes.md)

Markdown is essentially a translator. It assists the user by simplifying how to create what you want on a webpage. For example, in HTML where you might write 
```
<ul>
  <li> List item </li>
<li> Another list item </li?
</ul>
```
Markdown simplifies this process by allowing the user to create a list by writing
  ```
  1. List item
  2. Another list item
  ```
  Markdown takes a lot of the "leg work" out of having to use code to create and edit a website.

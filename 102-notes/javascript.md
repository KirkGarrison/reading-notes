## JavaScript

[Back page](/102-notes.md)

JavaScript is a programming tool used to make websites interactive.
It allows the coder to assign variables that react to user interaction.
A good example of this would be seen in a typical website log in.
The website asks for your name, email, etc. And after the user inputs their name, you may see a "Hello name", which would make the website interactive and responsive to the user feedback.

Javascript code examples:
```
var x = 5, y = 10, total = x + y;

```
If you type "total," the result would now display 15

- Permissions are used to allow or deny access to certain api requests, taking into account the user account type.

- The REST framework has different authentication classes.
        
        IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly

    - 2 examples shown above of different authentication classes. 
    - IsAuthenticated allows access to any and all authenticated users, and denies to all unauthenticated users.

    - IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly allows access to authenticated users, but ReadOnly to unauthenticated users.

Web Scraping

[Back Page](/401-notes.md)

- Web scraping is used for a number of different reasons. Some provided in the reading were to download a long list of documents, or to monitor the price of a product on a website.

- Web scraping allows you to design code to extract specific data from a website, and you can code statements into this, to alert you if something happens (for example, if a price reaches below a set amount, alert me via email).

- They reccommend if you use webscraping for large downloads of multiple files to also set a pause period in your code, so you don't get blocked by the website for downloading so many files at once.

Linear Regression

[Back Page](/401-notes.md)

Linear Regression has two axis', an X and a Y axis. There are two variables that ride on those axis, an independent, and a dependent (sometimes referred to as the explanatory variable, and the Response) variable.

When visualized, this creates a straight line showing the relationship between the X and Y axis, and can provide a lot of information regarding the 'response variable'.

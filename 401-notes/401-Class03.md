FileIO & Exceptions

[Back Page](/401-notes.md)


Todays reading was about Reading and Writing Files in Python.
I learned about opening 'open(' ')' and closing 'close()' files, which are the commands to open/close a file. I learned about directory navigation.
How to access content from varying levels, based on where you are at the time.

               ../file_name will access parent directory file
            ../../file_name will access grandparent directory.    


You can also use 'open' to append to a file. The open function can take a second argument, which is the 'mode' argument. If you use an 'a' for the mode argument, it will append the written object to the file.
You can also define what role you want to open the file with. As a reader, or as a writer. If you want to append, you need to open the file in the role of writer.   


Exceptions

- Today's reading also taught me about Exceptions.
Basically when you ask Python to 'try' something, it may or may not be able to do that thing. That's when you can define a few clauses, such as 'else,' 'finally' and 'except'

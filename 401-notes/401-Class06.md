Game of Greed II

[Back Page](/401-notes.md)

- This reading started on the topic of scope. Python uses what is know as the LEGB rule (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) which are the scope levels, as well as the steps to resolving names.

- Global Scope are the variables and methods available to anywhere in your code. Local Scope only provides access to those variables/methods from inside of a scope.

Namespaces are dictionaries that map names to objects. These Namespaces are stored in an attribute called

                    __dict__
These variables can be accessed with dot notation or by reaching into the dunder dict file.

This reading also had a video review of Big O notation.

Growth Mindset   

[Back Page](/401-notes.md)

- For this assignment, they showed multiple videos and readings discussing Growth mindset, and self evaluation. Carol Dweck was one of the speakers, and she talked about "the power of yet." She explained this by talking about an experiment where a school graded children with a "not yet" instead of a "failing" grade, and how this approach helped them view their own skills and effort. Instead of chalking up things into pass/fail, it was yet/not yet. Are you ready... yet?

- Other videos discussed what helped predict peoples ability to follow through with commitment and hard tasks, and what most likely predicted someone dropping out or giving up early.

- All of these videos and readings were really great perspective, and I hope to continue to put my best foot forward with applying a growth mindset and grit to my journey.

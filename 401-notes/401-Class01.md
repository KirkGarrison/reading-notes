Big O 

[Back Page](/401-notes.md)

This reading explained the Big O in a simplified manner. Basically it describes how quickly an algorithm will run, or how much data it will take to compute. It explains the different levels of the big O, and how they are computed and which will take longer to conduct than others.

This reading assignment also discussed Pain vs Suffering, and how the pain of growth can involve sacrifice. However, suffering is needless pain. Pain without a goal. From this I remind myself why I started CodeFellows to begin with, and why I am taking this very hard class.

I also learned about Python names and values. An excellent video was included where Ned Batchelder gives a power point explaning issues people might run into with Python Syntax, and he helps explain why things happen how they do, so the programmer has a better understanding of why their code is operating the way it is.

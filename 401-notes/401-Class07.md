- This reading demonstrates the efficiency of Python syntax when working with lists.
They provide an example of how you can run a for loop on a list, with an expression iterating on each item, and assigning to a new list, all in one line of code.

- I also learning about using list comprehensions with conditionals. (If x criteria is met, then do this). List comprehensions significantly reduce the amount of code needed to write for loops.

- Although list comprehensions will take a little practice to get truly proficient, this syntax will cut on the how much code is needed, and improve readability.

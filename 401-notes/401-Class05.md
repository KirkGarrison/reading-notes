Game of Greed

In this reading I learned about the random function works to create random values.

You can use this to create integers on a scale of 'between x and y' and it will create a random number, that will have a value between the low and high of the given numbers.

This reading also reviewed the risk assessment process. How to break down risk analysis and understand what goes into assessing outcomes and risks posed.

This reading dove into Test coverage, and what quality testing should be. You can have a lot of tests, but what is the tests purpose? Are they there to have meaningful tests of your code? Or were they written without much meaning, to just fulfil "writing a test." Tests should be meaningful, and thorough. Tests should not significantly slow down your code production, and they should help avoid bugs in production level.

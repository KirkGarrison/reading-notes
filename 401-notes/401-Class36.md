## Whiteboard interview tips

- Today's reading was on Whiteboard interview tips. 

- Communication is the #1 factor in the interview. Repeat the problem back to them, and confirm the input/output. You should also ask them if there are any specific tests the solution should pass.

- Ask them if the pseudo code makes sense (they may decline to give useful feedback on the code, but often times they will point out areas of the pseudo code that are incorrect).

- Convert pseudo code to regular code if possible.

- If you get stuck, you can always ask for help, just phrase the question conversationally. 'I am getting a bit stuck here, do you have any tips for me?'
 They might say no, but it's always worth asking if you get stuck.

## Django

[Back Page](/401-notes.md)

Django seems similiar to React in JavaScript.
However Django has some nice built in features, and looks easier to use.

Some of the featurs include built in authentication. So you can manage accounts and provide security on your site.

Another built in feature regarding authentication, is an Admin route. This greatly simplifies the process of designing a website with Admin and user authentication.

Django looks like a lot less code than React as well, with fewer imports and less structure required to get started.

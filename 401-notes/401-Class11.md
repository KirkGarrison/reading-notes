Jupyter and Numpy Arrays

[Back Page](/401-notes.md)

Jupyter is a program that allows you to combine a code editor with executatable python, and run Python on that code.

Numpy arrays are multidimensional arrays. Numpy arrays are limited to 1 data type, so the header row is often left blank, as to allow the additional rows to be float types. Numpy arrays can display data in matrix like fashion, with all kinds of stored data information. This reading goes over specific commands for creating and accessing data within a numpy array.

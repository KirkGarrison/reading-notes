## JWT with Django RestFramework

[Back Page](/401-notes.md)

- A JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are an api authorization token that grants api requests with auth.

- Unlike typical access tokens, JWT don't get saved on the DB.

- Using JWT requires installing simple JWT

- The command
        
        django runserver
    - provides a way to view and run your app locally, however this should not be used as a deployed production version, as the 'runserver' isn't optimized for efficiency, or security.
- This is where using a dedicated web server comes in. Using something like Nginx for example.

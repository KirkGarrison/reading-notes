## Django Models

[Back Page](/401-notes.md)


- Models in django are typically used as a subclass, and can include methods and fields.

- Models can have any number of fields and the fields can vary in type. Each field is visualized as a column of data in our database table.

- Some common field types are:
            
            CharField/TextField, IntegerField, EmailField, ForeignKey.

- You can also set Metadata on your model by declaring it.

- Every model should have a defined class method.

        ex: __str__()

- Models can be used for CRUD methods on your stored data, allowing you to create, update, and delete your records.

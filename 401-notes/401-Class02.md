Testing & Modules

- In today's reading I learned about the importance of TDD (test-driven development) with Python.
This reading showed different approaches to how you write a program, and whether you start with the coding aspect, or whether you start simple with getting the functions themselves to operate, and then filling in the blanks to make them work together. I learned about how using the test method first, and figuring out the bigger picture code second, can reduce the needed refactoring and potential bugs you may run into.

- This reading also went over the default values of file importation vs root file. 
Example:
    *       if __name__ == "__main__":
    And gave an explanation as to what this might mean.

- This reading covered Recursion, and what that means in coding. a recursive function is kind of like a for loop, repeating until the objective is reached. In this instance, each iteration of the recursive (for loop) cycle, is 'remembering' the value stored, and referencing it for each additional cycle.
An example would be figuring out what value factorial 5 holds.
Factorial 5's value is dependant on Factorial 4, 3, 2 & 1s value. So the function would need to iterate over itself, discovering each decending value (and remembering it) as it cycles.

Serverless

[Back Page](/401-notes.md)

- The name serverless means that the customer never see's, interacts, or manages any of the servers.

- With serverless, the customer only pays for it's services while the product is in direct use (no idle time!). And the products are only in use during the time it takes to execute the command.

- Pro's and Con's of Serverless:
    *       Pros: 
    - Provides Developers with more time to work on writing code and optimizing front-end apps. 
    - In certain environments, serverless can be more cost-effective and faster.
    - You only pay for the service during the time it takes to execute the code.

    *       Cons:
     - In cases where the server use is consistent, it becomes more cost effective to not use a serverless platform.
     -  Due to the hidden nature of the serverless platform, debugging server issues within the application can become harder.
     -  Because the server is only in use when the command is being executed, and it 'starts/stops' during code execution, the response time can be slower when the request is large. Because it is running from a 'cold start.'

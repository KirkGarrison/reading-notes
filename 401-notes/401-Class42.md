## Python Generators 

[Back Page](/401-notes.md)

- Today's reading covered Generators and how they work. 

- In one of the examples provided, we got to see a Generator being used to print out odd numbers.

- They demonstrated how this generator will return (or print) the odd numbers between a range, but you can also display all the results in that range at once, instead of one at a time.

- Generators also have the ability to execute, pause, then resume execution when called at a later time. This is a very special feature of the Generator.

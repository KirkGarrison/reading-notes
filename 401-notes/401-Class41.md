## Next.js Dynamic Routes and Deployment

[Back Page](/401-notes.md)

- This reading begins by explaining what a Dynamic route is. A dynamic route is a webpage url, that exists after something else has occured. Meaning the page does not exist by default as a static-page. This route uses async function in the example, as it relies on another event occuring before the dynamic page exists.

- The second part of this reading covers the steps needed to get your app running. They recommend Github and Vercel to store your repo and host the site.

- Vercel is a serverless server, which for this app, seems like a good fit.

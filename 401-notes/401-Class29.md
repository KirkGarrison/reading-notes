## Django Custom User

[Back Page](/401-notes.md)

- This reading covered the creation and set up of custom users within django.

- A custom user essentailly is just creating a profile for a specific person.
One way this is accomplished is with a
        
            unique=True

- custom users are created in a class that has a bunch of inputs. Email, Username, is_admin, etc. Each of these inputs take in parameters and default values. Unique=True is one of those, and that is creating a unique username every time (will not allow system duplicates).

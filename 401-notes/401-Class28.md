## Django Forms

[Back Page](/401-notes.md)

- Today the reading was on django forms, and how their syntax differs from that of HTML.

- django has some libraries available to it, one of them being forms.

- use:

        from django import forms

    to gain access to the built in django forms.

- django forms also offer many of the same form types as HTML.

            Boolean, Char, Choice, Date, Time, Integer, etc.

- You can also 'require' fields, much like HTML, and create a label (although not required)

- You can import ValidationError from django.core.exceptions
    - This will allow you to verify if the form inputs are meeting the criteria of a valid imput.

- For example, if you have a Time input field, you can create a function with validation, and you can define parameters as to what input meets, or does not meet the expectations. You can even custom write the response messages to their input!

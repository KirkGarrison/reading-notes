Classes & Objects

[Back Page](/401-notes.md)

- This chapter covered how classes work within Python.
a class can encompass multiple things. Classes can define a function, as well as hold variables. You can then call upon the entire class, variables within the class, or the function within the class.

You can also assign an additional variable name to the name of your class, and use dot notation to call upon objects from the class. You can also modify the objects by reassigning them as you call them (ex.. class.variable1 = 'new_var_name')
which will take variable1 from the class, and reassign it's value.

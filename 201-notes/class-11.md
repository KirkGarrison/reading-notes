- This MDN article on audio and video elements

    HTML5 comes with elements for embedding media in documents — `<video>` and `<audio>` which in turn come with their own APIs for controlling playback.
    The most interesting attribute is "controls," which enables the default set of playback controls. If you don't specify this, you do not get playback controls
    You can hide the default controls by removing the controls attribute and programming your own with HTML, CSS and JS;
    Part of the HTML5, the HTMLMediaElement API provides features that allow you to control video and audio players programmatically.

Since the late 1990s, Flash was a very popular technology used to add animations, video, and audio to websites.
Since 2005, a number of factors have meant that fewer websites are written in Flash or even use elements of Flash in their pages.
But this technology quickly evolved and people started using it to build media players and entire websites.

Reasons Why We Don't Use Flash Anymore:
in 2005/2006, a set of JavaScript libraries were launched which made it easier for people to create animated effects using JS
Apple decided not to support Flash when they launched the iPhone in 2007.
Flash content does not always meet accessibility requirements
In 2008, browsers started to support HTML5 `<video>` and `<audio>` tags.

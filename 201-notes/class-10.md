## Error Handling & Debugging

[Back page](README.md)


From the Duckett JS book:

- JavaScript book, Ch. 10, “Error Handling & Debugging”

    This chapter discusses debugging and how to deal with errors.
    It explains how debugging is the process of finding errors and deducing what the issue is.
    The console log dev tool is an example of a method of debugging.
    It provides information such as what the type of error might be, and what line it can be found on.
    Global Context is code that is in the script, but not in a function. There can only be one global context in any page
    Function context is code that is being run within a function. Each function has its own function context.
    Eval Context is text that is executed like code in an internal function called `eval()`
    Variable Scope is when the first two execution contexts correspond with scope.
    Global Scope is when a variable is declared outside a function and can be used anywhere because it has global scope. If you do not use the var keyword when creating a variable, it is placed in global scope
    Function-Level Scope is when a variable is declared inside of a function and can only be used within that function.

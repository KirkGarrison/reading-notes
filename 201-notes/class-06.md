- Understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming

    This article discusses the difficulties of programming, and how unfamiliarity or coding out something you aren't experienced at can be very difficult. I often see this myself when I watch a demo and everything looks quite simple, then when I am on my own trying to accomplish a similar task, it is much harder than how it looked in my head. The biggest difference is the teachers familiarity vs my own.

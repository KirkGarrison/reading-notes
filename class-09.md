## Forms and JS Events

[Back page](README.md)


From the Duckett HTML book:

- Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175)

    This chapter teaches forms, and explains whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a `<form>` element. It goes on to say information from a form is sent in name and/or value pairs. Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server. 

- Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms” (pp.330-357)

    This chapter covers lists, tables and forms. It explains that in addition to CSS properties, there are several others that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables and forms list markers.

From the Duckett JS book:

- Chapter 6: “Events” (pp.243-292)

This chapter covers events. It explains that events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened
such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked on.
Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon.
When an event occurs in an element, it can trigger a JS function.
That function changes the web page in some way and it feels interactive because it is responding to the user.
Event flow is the order in which the events fire off. Event Bubbling is when the events starts at a specific node and flows outwards to the least specific one. This is the default for most browsers.

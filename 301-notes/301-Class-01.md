Introduction to React and Components

[Back Page](301-notes.md)

- A component is an object that's designed to interact with other components. (Tutorialspoint)

-  ### The charactoristics of a component are:
    - Reusability
    - Replaceable 
    - Not context specific
    - Extensible
    - Encapsulated
    - Independent
     (Tutorialspoint)



- Some of the advantages of using component-based architecture are
        it's ease of deployment and development, it's reliability, the ability to modify it's technical complexity, and it's reduced cost via the use of third party components (tutorialspoint)

        ## Props

- Props is short for "properties"
- The use of Props in react is a 3 step process which involves defining an attribute and it's value, then passing it to the child component via Props, then rendering the Props data. (Itnext)
- Props flow is one way from parent to child.

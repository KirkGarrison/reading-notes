Passing Functions as Props

- What does .map() return?

        *Map returns the previous array inside of a new array. .map() will loop through a given array and essentially duplicate it to another array.

- If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

        *One method to accomplish this would be to create a variable, then loop through the desired array with .map(), then you can choose what method of display you would like to use. An example to display the values in an unordered list could look like this:

        *const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
        <li>{number}</li> );

        ReactDOM.render(
        <ul>{listItems}</ul>,
        document.getElementById('root'));

        Reference (reactjs)

- Each list item needs a unique ____.

        * Key

- What is the purpose of a key?

        * Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

## Functional Programing

[Back Page](301-notes.md)

-   What is functional programming?
    *       A style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evlauation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. (Wikipeida)
-   What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
    *       It is a function that has no noticable affects on the argument passed in. It returns as same as was given.
-   What are the benefits of a pure function?
    *       Because they are immutable, it gives them a good platform to use to test code.
-   What is immutability?
    *       Being immutable means it cannot be mutated (changed or altered)
-   What is Referential transparency?
    *       It means that you can replace the expression with the result for the same output



-   What is a module?
    *           A module is how you construct your directory into components to improve management and understandability.
-   What does the word ‘require’ do?
    *       It is a global function that brings a module into the section you are in.
-   How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
    *       By passing it via importation
-   What do we have to do to make a module available?
    *       We need to export the module with proper syntax

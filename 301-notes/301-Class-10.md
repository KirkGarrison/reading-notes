## Javascript call stack and Memory Storage

[Back Page](301-notes.md)


- What is a ‘call’?
    *       The code used to invoke a function.
- How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
    *       1
- What does LIFO mean?
    *       Last in, first out
- Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

- What causes a Stack Overflow?
    *       When a function doesn't end and causes a loop. This causes all the functions to "traffic jam" and not function properly.


## JavaScript error messages

- What is a ‘refrence error’?
    *       When you try to use a variable that hasn't been declared.
- What is a ‘syntax error’?
    *       When you cannot parse the info because of the syntax error
- What is a ‘range error’?
    *       A range error occurs when you attempt to get a part of data that is outside of it's length.
- What is a ‘tyep error’?
    *       When you try to access data for an incompatible daata type.
- What is a breakpoint?
    *       A break point will stop the code from executing when the point is reached.
- What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
    *       debuggers are useful similar to console.log, but can provide more specific feedback. You can also set debugger to run just specifically lines of code, and set parameters of only alerting if X thing is found.

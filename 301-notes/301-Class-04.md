React and Forms

- What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

    *     A controlled component is an element whose value is controlled by React in a way that allows it to be both mutable and self maintained.

- Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

    *       To prevent constant updating it would be advantageous to only update upon form submission.

- How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

    *       event.target.name

-  Why would we use a ternary operator?

    *       Code efficiency. One liners can help dry the code quite a bit with practice.

- Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

    *       let reWrite = x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
